# Credit Card Analytics Project: Revealing Trends and Insights Across Leading Banks

### Introduction

The Credit Card Analytics Project is a comprehensive analysis aimed at uncovering trends and insights across leading banks, ultimately achieving a 30% increase in transaction monitoring efficiency and a 15% boost in fraud detection accuracy.

The project leverages DAX formulas to answer a series of critical questions related to credit card issuance by major banks, including American Express, Bank of America, Citibank, Wells Fargo, and Barclays. It also delves into specific card types, such as Visa, MasterCard, Diner Club International, and Discover cards, issued by prominent banks like Chase, Barclays, Diners Club, and Discover Bank.
